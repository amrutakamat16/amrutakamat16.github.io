<b>GOAL:</b>    

For storing the workflows we are currently exploring possible options of graph databases. 

<b>POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:</b>    

I have looked into the Neo4J graph database which provides us an option of storing DAGs in the form of nodes and relationships between them. It uses the Cypher query language. Neo4j database basically because it has an option of storing data within the nodes. It can fetch data much faster than a relational database. Also one node can be a part of many DAGs thus removing the possiblity of duplication which would have been the case with relational database.    

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>     

I have added all my findings to the issue created on github. [Link](https://github.com/airavata-courses/spring17-workload-management/issues/3)
