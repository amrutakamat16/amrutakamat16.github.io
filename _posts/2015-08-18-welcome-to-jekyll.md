Welcome to my blog on distributed workload management!

Theme 3 focuses on finding possible solutions to the issue of managing workloads in a distributed environment with a micro-services based architecture, with emphasis on how these would benefit Apache Airavata. This leads to finding the best way that different micro-services (eg: Airavata micro-services) should communicate and distribute work, in such a way that:

We maintain the ability to scale these micro-services whenever needed (autoscale perhaps?).
The architecture achieves fault tolerance.
We can deploy these micro-services independently, or better in a containerized manner â€“ keeping in mind the ability to use devops for deployment.
